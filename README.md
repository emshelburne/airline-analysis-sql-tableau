# ‚úàÔ∏è Air Traffic Analysis: SQL + Tableau

This project analyzes flight and airport data from 2018‚Äì2019 to help a hypothetical company decide which of three major U.S. airlines to invest in.  
It combines **SQL-based data analysis** with **interactive Tableau visualizations** to extract actionable business insights on cancellations, delays, and airline performance.

## üßÆ Part 1: Data Analysis in SQL

**Tools:** MySQL Workbench  

**Objectives:**
- Compare flight activity across 2018‚Äì2019  
- Analyze cancellation causes and monthly cyclic patterns  
- Compute total miles traveled and year-over-year change by airline  
- Identify busiest destination airports  
- Estimate operating cost structure via aircraft counts and distance-per-plane metrics  
- Evaluate on-time performance across time-of-day and airports  

Each query is **fully commented** with explanations and business interpretations.

## üìä Part 2: Visual Analytics in Tableau

**Tools:** Tableau (connected live to MySQL)

**Dashboards include:**
- ‚úàÔ∏è *Flight Activity Trends* ‚Äì monthly flight counts by carrier  
- üö´ *Cancellations & Delays* ‚Äì breakdown by reason, month, and state  
- üåç *US Delay Map* ‚Äì average departure delay by state  
- üõ© *Fleet & Distance Insights* ‚Äì aircraft utilization and efficiency  
- üíº *Interactive Storyboard* ‚Äì investor-focused narrative summarizing all findings  

Each visualization includes titles, captions, and annotations highlighting insights.

## üí° Key Findings

## üí° Key Findings (from SQL)

**Dataset coverage**
- Total flights (2018‚Äì2019): **6,521,361**

**Reliability overview**
- Late departures: **2,540,874** (**38.96%** of all flights)  
- Cancellations: **92,363** (**1.42%**)  
- Late **or** cancelled combined: **2,633,237** (**40.38%**)

**Cancellation reasons (share of all flights)**
- Weather: **50,225** (**0.77%**)  
- Carrier: **34,141** (**0.52%**)  
- National Air System: **7,962** (**0.12%**)  
- Security: **35** (**0.00%**)

**2019 monthly seasonality (cancel % of flights)**
- Peak cancellations: **April 2.71%**, **March 2.50%**, **May 2.42%**  
- Lowest cancellations: **December 0.51%**, **November 0.59%**, **October 0.81%**  
- Flight volume (2019) highest in **July (291,955)** and **August (290,493)**; lowest in **February (237,896)**.  
  ‚áí Clear summer demand peak; higher spring cancellations likely weather/system related.

**YoY performance by airline (2019 vs 2018; non-cancelled flights only)**
- **Delta Air Lines**: **+5.78%** miles, **+4.69%** flights  
- **American Airlines**: **+0.04%** miles, **+2.74%** flights  
- **Southwest**: **‚Äì1.32%** miles, **‚Äì0.30%** flights

## üìà Investment Guidance (from analysis)

- **Recommend Overweight: Delta Air Lines** ‚Äî simultaneous growth in **miles (+5.78%)** and **flights (+4.69%)** signals healthy expansion with balanced fleet utilization (~1.75M miles/aircraft).  
- **Neutral/Hold: American Airlines** ‚Äî modest **miles (+0.04%)** with **flights (+2.74%)** suggests mix shift toward shorter routes; large fleet implies higher fixed costs but broad network resilience.  
- **Underweight: Southwest** ‚Äî declines in **miles (‚Äì1.32%)** and **flights (‚Äì0.30%)** despite the **highest miles per aircraft (~2.64M)** point to tighter fleet leverage and potential maintenance/ops cost pressure.  
- **Operational risk note:** Carriers with heavy exposure to high-delay hubs (e.g., SFO, IAH, ORD, LAX) may see elevated knock-on delays and customer-experience costs; spring months carry higher cancel risk.

> Overall: **Delta** offers the strongest momentum and operational balance in this 2018‚Äì2019 window; **American** is steady but route-mix dependent; **Southwest** shows softening activity and higher per-aircraft strain.
